This is a program to ray cast boxes in javascript.

rayTrackingBoxes() - is the new function I have created to ray cast boxes. I have tried to implement the algorithm discussed in the class. The function doesn’t work correctly right now as I haven’t been able to write certain parts of the function correctly.

drawInputBoxesUsingPaths() - This function is called to draw the json files that are being imputed. This function is responsible for the boxes obtained while opening the browser now.
